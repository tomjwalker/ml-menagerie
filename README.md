Implementations of common ML algorithms

## 1. Reinforcement Learning
Implementing various (vanilla) RL algorithms from the Sutton & Barto book, in NumPy, and testing on Toy Text environments from Gymnasium

## 2. Supervised Learning
Impllementing a (feed-forward) Neural Network framework from scratch, in NumPy (including backprop equations). Application on the MNIST handwritten digits classification task
